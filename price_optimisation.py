"""Whiteboard-style linear programme for coffee-capsule prices.

Decision variables are the Regular price R and the Premium price P. Each
household buys a fixed quantity of one product, so revenue is linear in the
two prices. Which product they buy is a straight line in the R-P plane, fitted
by OLS from the weekly data (a linear probability model). Product assignments
are separate linear programmes; the best feasible one is kept.

The earlier successive linear programme of quadratic OLS revenue has been
retired. This module is the only price model the app uses.

Class-board numbers are not copied from anywhere. Slopes, intercepts, and
quantities are estimated here. Household 2 is the exception: its switching
line is the horizontal threshold P = 77.5, which separates every week. The
OLS line misclassified week 6 (R = 55, P = 80).

FORMULATION_SUMMARY = """
Decision variables are the Regular price R and the Premium price P, both non-negative.

Each household buys a fixed quantity of one product (the average units bought on weeks they chose that product). Revenue is therefore linear: quantity times the price of the product they buy.

The product is not a decision variable inside one programme. Each household is a straight line in the R-P plane. Household 1 and Household 3 are fitted by OLS (a linear probability model at the 0.5 contour). Household 2's line is the horizontal threshold P = 77.5, because the OLS fit misclassified week 6 (R = 55, P = 80). One side of the line is Premium, the other is Regular, and a household that sometimes buys nothing also has a stop-buying line. Each assignment of products to households is its own linear programme. The assignment with the highest feasible revenue is the shared menu.

`scipy.optimize.linprog` minimises, so the objective vector is the negated quantity vector. Upper price bounds are the highest Regular and Premium prices in the experiment, so a price cannot run off to infinity. Those bounds are data, not demand coefficients.
